# UdacityPortfolio
My Udacity Portfolio Site Project
For CSS, I used bootstrap 3.3.7, and I also borrowed a few lines from bootstrap 4.0.0alpha6, because it supported certain flex-box properties.
I also grabbed a freenom domain, so I can use this as a personal website going forward: ben-steward.cf. Thanks, Udacity!
