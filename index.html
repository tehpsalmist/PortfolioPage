                    </h3>
                    <p>My boss approached me with the idea of having a conference to bring together the speakers from some of the various college/career preparation seminars we have had at our school this year. As I was working on putting the conference together, it seemed right to me that we should have a landing page to direct our potential guests. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I think it turned out great! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://forwardconference.cf">Check it out!</a></p>

                    <p>I absolutely love skateboarding, but buying decks is expensive if you keep breaking them but like to ride quality boards. So, my solution was to try to start a Christian skateboard brand, so I could sell quality decks at a fair price to guys like me who love skating but aren't made of money. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ownedskateboards.com">Here's the (very unfinished) website.</a></p>

                    <p>When I went through the free version of the Intro to HTML and CSS course, I gave this project a whirl, and tried to do a lot of stuff with it. It was fun, and mildly successful...for a little while. I actually have no idea what went wrong, but I let it sit for a week, and when I came back, all my images were distorted on desktop, but on mobile they were fine. I haven't touched it since... <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ben-steward.cf">Have a laugh!</a></p>
