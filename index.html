                    </h3>
                    <p>My boss approached me with the idea of having a conference to bring together the speakers from some of the various college/career preparation seminars we have had at our school this year. As I was working on putting the conference together, it seemed right to me that we should have a landing page to direct our potential guests. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I think it turned out great! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://forwardconference.cf">Check it out!</a></p>

                    <p>The most important reason this is featured here is that this is one of the projects that first prompted me to investigate computer code languages. I didn't necessarily write anything complex code-wise (since I knew no code), but I did design some rather readable and pleasantly-formatted reports, and in the process was introduced to the world of html and javascript loops. And now here I am doing the real thing--sort of...<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tehpsalmist/TemplateShowcase">View the templates in my github repo.</a></p>

                        OWNED SKATEBOARDS

                    <p>I absolutely love skateboarding, but buying decks gets expensive when you break them on a monthly basis. So, my solution was to try to start a Christian skateboard brand, with the idea that I would sell quality decks at a fair price to guys like me who love skating but aren't made of money. I had to put much of the initiative on hold due to job/life events, but I still plan to make it into something meaningful for the local skate community in the near future. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ownedskateboards.com">Here's the website.</a></p>

                    <p>When I went through the free version of the Intro to HTML and CSS course, I gave this project a whirl, and tried to do a lot of stuff with it. It was fun, and mildly successful...for a little while. I actually have no idea what went wrong, but I let it sit for a week, and when I came back, all my images were distorted on desktop, but on mobile they were fine. I haven't touched it since... <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ben-steward.cf">Have a laugh!</a></p>

                    <p>Like the Report Card Templates, I plan to craft a readable-and-attractive report for student transcripts. The default reports in RenWeb for these sort of things are, quite frankly, gross, but actually designing a functional custom transcript with all the bells and whistles is no walk through the halls. So, it's been a few years now, but I hope with my newly acquired skills to be able to pull it off before summer ends. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://placekitten.com/700/450">Cute cat. </a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="images/DevRage.gif">Reality.</a></p>
